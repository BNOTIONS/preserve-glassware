Why Preserve? <br><br>

People need a way to quickly take notes while on the go or when they are unable to use their hands to type. So Preserve can make quick notes with a single tap on Glass and the beautiful sound of your voice. When people want to take a visual note, such as a whiteboard, we allow you upload directly to Google Drive. Google will automatically index the text in your images and allow you to search them later using keywords from the captured image. 

<br><br>
How does it work?
<br><br>
Authorize with our Glassware service by clicking the Login button and pin the Preserve card that you will receive from us a couple minutes after authorizing. Go to google.com/myglass and enable the Preserve Sharing Contact under the Sharing tab. When you are ready to take a note, select the Text Note option from the Preserve card. When you want to upload a photo, share the photo with the Preserve Sharing Contact.<br><br>
